    <h2><b>Jan 15, 2005</b> XStream 1.1 released</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Improved support for serializing objects as per the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/serialization/spec/serialTOC.html">Java Serialization</a> Specification:
        <ul>
            <li>Calls custom serialization methods, readObject(), writeObject(), readResolve() and writeReplace() in class, if defined.</li>
            <li>Supports ObjectInputStream.getFields() and ObjectOutputStream.putFields() in custom serialization.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Provides implementations of ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream, allowing drop in replacements for standard serialization,
        including support for streams of objects. [<a href="objectstream.html">More...</a>]</li>
        <li>Reads and writes directly to most XML Java APIs: DOM, DOM4J, JDOM, XOM, Electric XML, StAX, Trax (write only), SAX (write only).
        [<a href="javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/io/xml/package-summary.html">More...</a>]</li>
