    <h1>Version 1.1.1</h1>

    <p>Released Mar 7, 2005. Mostly bugfixes and minor feature enhancements.</p>

    <h2>Major changes</h2>

    <ul>
		<li>Converters can be registered with a priority, allowing more <i>generic</i> filters to handle classes that don't have more specific converters.</li>
		<li>Converters can now access underlying HierarchicalStreamReader/Writer implementations to make implementation specific calls.</li>

		<li>JIRA:XSTR-199 Default ClassLoader may be changed using XStream.setClassLoader().</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Minor changes</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Bugfix: Thread context classloader is loaded by the correct thread. (Thanks to Padraic Renaghan for pointing this out).</li>
        <li>Bugfix: Default implementations of aliased classes were not being deserialized by SerializableConverter.</li>
        <li>Bugfix: JIRA:XSTR-180 Serializable objects support defaultReadObject() even when no default fields available.</li>
		<li>Bugfix: For serialized objects class hierarchy is serialized starting with superclass (as per Java Object Serialization).</li>
		<li>Bugfix: readObject() is now called for classes containing only transient fields.</li>
		<li>Bugfix: Order of fields are maintained when calling ObjectOutputStream.putFields().</li>
		<li>Bugfix: FontConverter extended to support FontUIResource which does some awkward native calls.</li>
		<li>Bugfix: Deserialization of very complicated graphs (such as Swing components) sometimes resulted in broken object references. Now fixed.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>API changes</h2>

    <ul>
    	<li>ClassMapper is now deprecated. Replaced with MapperWrapper.</li>
        <li>HierarchicalStreamWriter implementations must now implement close(), flush() and underlyingWriter().</li>
        <li>HierarchicalStreamReader implementations must now implement close() and underlyingReader().</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Version 1.1</h1>

    <p>Released Jan 15, 2005. Focus on support for objects defining custom serialization using the standard
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/serialization/spec/serialTOC.html">Java serialization</a> mechanism.</p>

    <h2>Major changes</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Provides drop in replacement for ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream, using XStream.createObjectInputStream() and
        XStream.createObjectOutputStream() and XStream.createObjectInputStream(). This provides support for streaming objects.</li>
        <li>Support for objects that specify their own serialization schemes by implementing readObject() and writeObject()
        (as in Java serialization spec). This includes support for ObjectInputStream.getFields() and ObjectOuputStream.putFields().</li>
        <li>Support for objects to serialize other objects to the stream by implementing writeReplace() (as in Java serialization spec).</li>
        <li>Support for any object that performs custom serialization by implementing java.io.Externalizable (as in Java serialization spec).</li>
        <li>Implicit collections can be specified for classes, allowing the element wrapping the collection to be skipped.</li>
        <li>New writer implementations to allow XStream to serialize directly to a SAX stream or TrAX pipeline.</li>
        <li>The MarshallingContext and UnmarshallingContext interfaces now extend DataHolder, allowing arbitary data to be stored
        by the user whilst walking the object graph and passed around to Converters. DataHolders can also be passed into
        XStream from the outside.</li>
        <li>Includes new DomWriter implementation to serialize directly to a W3C DOM tree (to complement the existing DomReader).</li>
        <li>Better support for instantiating objects on non Sun 1.4+ JVMs, including non-public constructors, private static inner classes and
        ANY class that implements java.io.Serializable.</li>
        <li>DOM, DOM4J, JDOM, XOM, Electric-XML, SAX, STAX</li>
        <li>Specific ClassLoaders can be passed into XStream, to allow for greater compatability in J2EE containers.</li>
        <li>Ability to change the default converter</li>
        <li>Added optional ISO8601DateConverter for full ISO8601 date format support. The converter is not registered by default
        as it requires the joda-time dependency (http://joda-time.sf.net). To use, ensure joda-time is in classpath and register explicitly.</li>
        <li>Enhanced mode is now supported on the Apple 1.4 JDK.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Minor changes</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>PrettyPrintWriter only flushes stream when necessary - large performance improvement for serialization.</li>
        <li>Added XStream.fromXml(xml, root) convenience methods for deserializing into an existing root object.</li>
        <li>JDK 1.3 compatability: Added mechanism for accessing nested exception.</li>
        <li>JDK 1.3 compatability: GregorianCalendarConverter only calls Calendar.getTimeInMillis() the JDK supports it.</li>
        <li>Bugfix: All caches are now synchronized - there were some thread safety issues.</li>
        <li>Bugfix: Only <i>immutable</i> basic types will have references ignored in XML (for clarity).</li>
        <li>Bugfix: Class names can contain underscores.</li>
        <li>Bugfix: Support for '\0' char.</li>
        <li>Bugfix: PropertyConverter no longer attempts to serialize subclasses of Properties.</li>
        <li>Bugfix: JVM detection uses system properties, which is more accurate than searching the classpath.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>API changes</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>XStream.addDefaultCollection() has been deprecated. Use XStream.addImplicitCollection() instead.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Version 1.0.2</h1>

    <p>Released Aug 7, 2004. Focus on improving the converters bundled with XStream to support a wider range of types.</p>

    <h2>Major changes</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>XML elements are written in order they are defined in class, rather than alphabetical.</li>
        <li>Converters for java.io.File, java.sql.Timestamp, java.awt.Color, and dynamic proxies are now
        registered by default.</li>
        <li>EncodedByteArrayConverter is now registered by default and uses a single Base64 string to store the contents
        of a byte[]. This now works on all JVMs as it no longer relies on Sun specific classes. This converter will also
        unmarshal byte[] that have been serialized without it, for backwards compatability.</li>
        <li>New converters for java.sql.Time, java.sql.Date, java.util.Locale, java.util.Currency, java.util.Calendar
        and java.awt.Font.</li>
        <li>All caching is done in XStream instance instead of statics, allowing applications that use hot redeployment
        of classes to use XStream in a parent classloader.</li>
        <li>XStream will fail fast if a field value is defined more than once in XML when deserializing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Minor changes</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>The &lt;entry&gt; element used in Maps can now be specified by creating an alias for java.util.Map.Entry.</li>
        <li>Bugfix: Fields with characters that generate invalid XML (such as $ signs) are now escaped.</li>
        <li>Bugfix: Pre-instantiated objects can be unmarshalled through multiple levels.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>API changes</h2>

        <li>New converters for Throwable and StackTraceElement that retain stack trace (JDK 1.4 only)</li>
        <li>Bugfix: System.identityHashCode() is not guaranteed to be unique. Ensure reference checking is used as well.</li>
        <li>Bugfix: Allows user classes to be defined in WEB-INF/classes in Servlet environments. Tries to use context classloader if available.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>API changes</h2>

    <ul>
