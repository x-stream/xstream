    <h2>Subversion</h2>
    
    XStream uses Subversion as the SCM.  See <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion website</a> for details and documentation on IDE integration.

	<h2>Svnserve Access</h2>

	Svnserve access is via a specific port (typically 3690 on Unix systems) and requires ssh access for developers.  This is often not allowed by corporate firewalls.

	<h3>Anonymous Access</h3>
	
		<div class="Source"><pre>svn co svn://svn.xstream.codehaus.org/xstream/scm/trunk</pre></div>
		
	<h3>Developer Access over SSH</h3>
	
		<p>
		<div class="Source"><pre>svn co svn+ssh://username@svn.xstream.codehaus.org/scm/xstream/trunk</pre></div>
		where username is your unix Codehaus username.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>Note</b>: the path is different when accessing over SSH, ie scm/xstream in place of xstream/scm. 
		</p>

	<h2>WebDav Access</h2>

	WebDav is an alternative access protocol supported by SVN and being http-based is often allowed by corporate firewalls. 

	<h3>WebDAV over SSL</h3>

		<div class="Source"><pre>svn co https://svn.codehaus.org/xstream/trunk</pre></div>

		<p>
		This access protocol is available to all, but only developers can commit changes.    
		</p>
		<p>
		Developers require a unix password for Codehaus username (contact Bob at the Haus to get assigned a password if you don't have one).
		</p>
		<p>
		To test https commit access, one may eg: 
			<div class="Source"><pre>
svn co https://svn.codehaus.org/xstream/trunk xstream
cd xstream
echo "test" > TEST
svn add TEST
svn commit --username username --password your-password --message "Testing https"
			</pre></div>
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>Note</b>: you only need to specify username and password once per client.
		</p>
	
	<h2>Modules</h2>

	XStream project consists of two modules:  xstream and xstream-website.
	When you checkout the trunk you'll get both, but you can just add the module you are interested in to the URL, eg
		<div class="Source"><pre>svn co https://svn.codehaus.org/xstream/trunk/xstream xstream</pre></div>
		<div class="Source"><pre>svn co https://svn.codehaus.org/xstream/trunk/xstream-website xstream-website</pre></div>
	checkout out the two modules separately.
