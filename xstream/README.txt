--[ Binaries ]-----------------------------------------------

The root directory contains xstream.jar. For most uses, this
is all you need to include in your classpath to use XStream.

All libraries in the 'lib' directory are used at build time,
or are optional extras used for tighter integration with
third party libraries. XPP3 is recommend for use as it will
greatly improve the performance of XStream.

--[ Documentation ]------------------------------------------

Documentation can be found in docs/index.html. This includes:
 * Introduction and tutorial
 * JavaDoc
 * Change log
 * Frequently asked questions

--[ Source ]-------------------------------------------------

The complete source for XStream is bundled. This includes:
 * Main API [src/java]
 * Unit tests [src/test]
 * Ant build file [build.xml]
 * Dependencies [lib]
