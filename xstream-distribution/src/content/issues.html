    <title>Reporting Issues</title>
  </head>
  <body>

    <p>XStream tracks and manages its issues in <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/">JIRA of Atlassian</a>,
    that is supported by the Codehaus infrastructure and is free for open source development.</p>
    
    <h2 id="account">JIRA Account</h2>
    
    <p>Before you can report, comment or vote for an issue you need an account for the Codehaus. This account is then also used for
    Codehaus' JIRA installation. Simply sign up at <a href="http://xircles.codehaus.org">xircles</a> and on top you're able to manage all
    the mailing list subscriptions at Codehaus inclusive XStream's lists also. This is necessary to reduce spam in the system and as benefit
    you can be notified if work is done on your reported issues.</p>
    
    <h2 id="policy">Policy</h2>
    
    <p>Please, before opening a new issue look through the open or resolved ones, you may already find your problem. Also do not
    use the system to ask questions, for that purpose we have a <a href="list-user.html">user list</a>. We read the list continuously.
    If you are unsure whether the problem is caused by a bug or your usage of XStream, use the user's list first. If we can confirm a bug,
    you may still open an issue. Also do not report on the list that you have created a new issue, we are already notified by the system.</p>
    
    <p>If you like to contribute code, we prefer a patch/diff in contrast to the complete modified file - unless the file itself is new. Please
    provide also unit tests, XStream has a high test coverage and we like to keep this. Additionally, if you provide new files, please also add
    a header with the copyright. It must be a BSD license, simply take the header of any other file in the distribution as template. Otherwise
    we might not be able to add any code of you.</p>
