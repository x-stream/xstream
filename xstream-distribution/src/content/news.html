    <h2 id="1.2.2"><b>May 24, 2007</b> XStream 1.2.2 released</h2>
    
    <p>A maintenance release of XStream that contains a lot of bug fixes and has some minor highlights:
    
	  <ul>
    	<li>JSON serialization and deserialization support with the help of the new JettisonMappedXmlDriver</li>
        <li>Supports customized field sorting</li>
        <li>Omitting fields at deserialization time</li>
   	  </ul>
      <p>View the complete <a href="changes.html">change log</a> and <a href="download.html">download</a>.</p>
      
    <p class="hightlight">Note, that next version of XStream will behave slightly different by default.  XStream emits
    all fields in declaration order like Java serialization.  But in contrast to Java it will omit the fields of parent
    classes last while Java serialization emits them first.  This makes it difficult to match a given XML schema that
    defined inherited types or leads sometimes to obscure initialization problems.  However, XStream itself will not be
    affected by the changed order of elements in the XML, any deserialization of current XML representations will work
    fine.  Anyway we will provide with XStream 1.3 a FieldKeySorter implementation that mimics the old behaviour.  In
    the meanwhile you can enforce the new field sorting by installing the NaturalFieldKeySorter.</p>

    <h2 id="1.2.1"><b>Nov 11, 2006</b> XStream 1.2.1 released</h2>
	  <ul>
    	<li>Introduced DocumentWriter interface and generalized functionality for all writer implementations
    	creating a DOM structure (DOM4J, DOM, JDom, Xom, Xpp3Dom).</li>
        <li>Refactor of build system to use Maven 2.  Ant still supported on XStream Core.</li>
        <li>Created separate XStream Benchmark module</li>
   	  </ul>

    <h2 id="project-lead-joehni"><b>Oct 10, 2006</b>Joe Walness announcing new XStream Project Lead</h2>
      <p>I have been the XStream project lead, since it was open sourced 3 years ago. In that time, it has attracted some 
      excellent developers who have formed the foundations of the user community, made all kinds of significant improvements 
      and pushed out new releases. It's now approaching its 1000th commit.</p>

	<p>The development community that has formed around XStream has been outstanding - more than I could ever have 
	imagined. In particular, the following people have invested a lot of time into XStream, both from a technical and social point of 
	view:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>J&ouml;rg Schaible</li>
		<li>Mauro Talevi</li>
		<li>Guilherme Silveira</li>
		<li>Jason van Zyl</li>
		<li>Me (well I have!)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Recently I have been turning my attention to other things and XStream has been very much a self sustaining project. I've 
	decided that the project would benefit from have a project lead who can invest a lot more time than I can currently offer.</p>

	<p>So, the new XStream project lead will be J&ouml;rg Schaible, who along with Mauro Talevi and Guilherme Silveira will carry 
	XStream forward. This has been happening for a long while anyway, it's just none of us ever realised or acknowledged it.</p>

	<p>Of course, I'll still be lurking around, helping the transition, having loud mouth opinions and generally annoying people in any 
	way I can... you haven't got rid of me that easily. ;) </p>

	<p>I know J&ouml;rg, Mauro and Guilherme will be able carry XStream into the next generation (we have a lot of ambitious plans 
	for XStream 2).</p>

	<p>I'd also like to thank the 45(!) other <a href="team.html">contributers</a> to the XStream project, who have all helped 
	make it what it is today. Finally, thanks to Graham Glass, who's Electric XML library formed a lot of the inspiration for XStream.</p>
