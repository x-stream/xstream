	<h2>Minor changes</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>GHI:#233: Support serializable types with non-serializable parent with PureJavaReflectionConverter.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Stream compatibility</h2>

	<p class="highlight">Starting with version 1.14.12 nine years ago, XStream contains a
	<a href="security.html#framework">Security Framework</a> to implement a black- or whitelist for the allowed types
	at deserialization time.  Until version 1.4.17, XStream kept a default blacklist in order to deny all types of the
	Java runtime, which are used for all kinds of <a href="security.html#CVEs">security attacks</a>, in order to
	guarantee optimal runtime compatibility for existing users.  However, this approach has failed.  The last months
	have shown, that the Java runtime alone contains dozens of types that can be used for an attack, not even looking
	at the 3rd party libraries on a classpath.  The new version of XStream uses therefore now by default a whitelist,
	which is recommended since nine years.  It also has been complaining on the console for a long time about an
	uninitialized security framework the first time it was run.  Anyone who has followed the advice and initialized the
	security framework for their own scenario can easily update to the new version without any problem. Everyone else
	will have to do a proper initialization now, otherwise the new version will fail with certainty at deserialization
	time.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>the type hierarchies for java.io.InputStream, java.nio.channels.Channel,

			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Dependencies</h2>
	
	<p>The default parser of XStream has changed from the Xpp3Parser in artifact xpp3:xpp3_min to MXParser, a fork of
	Xpp3 in the artifact io.github.x-stream:mxparser.  The Xpp3 is unmaintained for a long time, bugs have been fixed
	reported more than a decade ago, improvements by other forks have been incorporated and some endless loops have
	been fixed, that could have been utilized as DoS attack.</p>

	<p>XStream has therefore new default dependencies.  If you have used XStream with the default driver (i.e. Xpp3),
	you can still exchange the XStream library for a drop-in replacement, but you will also have to remove the Xpp3 and
	add the MXParser library instead.</p>

	<p>For build time you will have to add the Xpp3 library to your dependencies, if you made explicitly use of the
	Xpp3 driver.	If you did explicitly use a different driver than Xpp3 and had therefore excluded the Xpp3
	dependency, you might have to exclude now the new MXParser dependency instead to minimize your dependency list.</p>

	<h1 id="1.4.15">1.4.15</h1>

	<p>Released December 13, 2020.</p>

	<p class="highlight">This maintenance release addresses the security vulnerabilities
	<a href="CVE-2020-26258.html">CVE-2020-26258</a> and <a href="CVE-2020-26259.html">CVE-2020-26259</a>, when
	unmarshalling with XStream instances using an uninitialized security framework.</p>

	<h2>Minor changes</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>GHI:#226: XmlFriendlyNameCoder does not accept '9' as valid character in an XML name.</li>
		<li>GHPR:#228: DefaultMapper should handle IllegalArgumentException thrown by Class.forName().</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Stream compatibility</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>The type jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString and the internal JAX-WS type ReadAllStream.FileStream
		are now	part of the default blacklist and the deserialization of XML containing one of the two types will fail.
		You will have to enable these types by explicit configuration, if you need them.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Delivery</h2>

	<p>Any XStream release can run with a minimal Java runtime environment of Java 1.4 as long as this environment will
	process only requested classes of the jar file.  Until version 1.4.14 XStream was delivered also as special Java 7
	version for Android, because Dalvik scans all classes and fails at classes requiring a higher runtime version.  However, this
	special version will not work in a normal Java 8 environment or higher and was never meant do so.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, this version has to be build always after the standard version due to the build sequence.  The
	latest version in Maven Central however is always the one that has been deployed last independently from the time
	of publishing.  This creates an annoyance now in GitHub for any project using the Dependabot service which creates
	automated pull requests with updates to the latest XStream version, because it injects now the special Java 7
	version that probably breaks these projects.</p>

	<p>Users who still require a special version for Java 7 will have to build this artifact now on their own.  Users
	for even older Java environments had always to do so anyway.</p>

	<p class="highlight">This maintenance release addresses again the security vulnerability <a href="CVE-2013-7285.html">
	    CVE-2013-7285</a>, an arbitrary execution of commands when unmarshalling with XStream instances using an

	<h2>Major changes</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>JIRA:XSTR-566 and JIRA:XSTR-200: Better compatibility with GAE and environments with active SecurityManager
			(i.e. in an Applet). XStream converters try now to ensure already in the canConvert methods that they can handle the
			requested type in practice and not only theoretically. Additionally the implementations even better take care, that
			the initialization of a converter will not break the setup of XStream itself. Following modifications have been done
			for these topics:
			<ul>
				<li>ReflectionConverter, SerializationConverter and LookAndFieldConverter will check if they can access the
					fields by reflection for a requested type.</li>
				<li>SerializationConverter and ExternalizableConverter will check if they can create an instance of a derived
					OutputObjectStream first.</li>
				<li>BeanProvider does no longer use reflection to locate default constructor.</li>
				<li>AbstractAttributedCharacterIteratorAttributeConverter (and therefore TextAttributeConverter) will check
					first if it can access the possible constants of the type by reflection.</li>
				<li>NoClassDefFoundError raised in GAE accessing the fields of restricted types by reflection will be handled.</li>
				<li>StackTraceElementConverter uses constructor for StackTraceElement instances in Java 5 and GEA.</li>

	<p>Released December 6, 2008.</p>

	<p class="highlight">CGLIB support must be explicitly activated now. The decision has been made due to possible

		classpath (JIRA:XSTR-469, JIRA:XSTR-513 and JIRA:XSTR-518).</p>

	<p class="highlight">XStream uses some attributes on its own. Until now it was possible to use

	<h2>API changes</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>c.t.x.annotation.Annotations, c.t.x.annotation.AnnotationReflectionConverter and
			c.t.x.annotation.AnnotationProvider deprecated. Functionality is integrated in new c.t.x.mapper.AnnotationMapper and
			accessible with new methods c.t.x.XStream.processAnnotations().</li>
		<li>New auto-detection mode for annotations, that can be turned on with c.t.x.XStream.autodetectAnnotations()</li>
		<li>c.t.x.annotation.@XStreamContainedType deprecated, the behaviour is now always active and the annotation
			therefore superfluous.</li>
		<li>Due to JIRA:XSTR-421 null characters are no longer written as tag with an attribute (&lt;char
			null=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;), but as empty tag. The old representation is still supported at deserialization.</li>
		<li>Characters that are not defined in unicode or ISO control characters (expect TAB and LF) are written as
			numerical entity now.</li>
		<li>XPath references are now also XML-friendly encoded to match the path exactly. Unencoded references will
			normally work anyway, but in special cases the exact behaviour of XStream 1.2.x might be necessary. See acceptance
			tests for XStream 1.2.x compatibility.</li>
		<li>c.t.x.core.BaseException deprecated in favour of c.t.x.XStreamException as base exception for all exceptions
			XStream throws.</li>
		<li>c.t.x.XStream.InitializerException deprecated in favour of c.t.x.InitializerException.</li>
		<li>New methods get() and keys() in interface c.t.x.converter.ErrorWriter.</li>
		<li>c.t.x.mapper.XmlFriendlyMapper deprecated, technology is replaced since version 1.2 by
			c.t.x.io.xml.XmlFriendlyReplacer as part of the different XmlWriter implementations.</li>
		<li>c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.aliasForAttribute() and c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.attributeForAlias() deprecated, since it
			provided in reality the combined functionality of c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.serializedMember()/realMember() and
			c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.getConverterFromItemType().</li>
		<li>c.t.x.XStream(ReflectionProvider, Mapper, HierarchicalStreamDriver) deprecated, in favour of
			c.t.x.XStream(ReflectionProvider, HierarchicalStreamDriver, Mapper, ClassLoader).</li>
		<li>New interface c.t.x.converter.ConverterRegistry to express explicit functionality managing the converters.</li>
		<li>c.t.x.core.DefaultConverterLookup no longer uses a c.t.x.mapper.Mapper. Therefore the old constructor has
			been deprecated in favour of a default constructor.</li>
		<li>Overloaded methods of c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.getConverterFromItemType and
			c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.getConverterFromAttribute have been deprecated. Only one version has been kept, the
			implementation can handle all cases now at once and therefore multiple calls to the mapper chain are avoided.</li>
		<li>c.t.x.mapper.EnumMapper derives now from the c.t.x.mapper.AttributeMapper to support enums as attributes.
			Therefore the old constructor has been deprecated in favour of one taking an additional
			c.t.x.converters.ConverterLookup that has to be passed to the new parent.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="highlight">Note, to support a representation of null values in some way, it is absolutely necessary that
		each converter can handle a null value in its marshalling methods. If you have implemented your own custom converters,
		try to handle such a case also to prevent incompatibilities in case XStream will provide such values with its next
		major version.</p>

	<h1 id="1.2.2">Version 1.2.2</h1>

	<p>Released May 24, 2007.</p>

	<p class="hightlight">Note, that next version of XStream will behave slightly different by default. XStream emits
		all fields in declaration order like Java serialization. But in contrast to Java it will omit the fields of parent
		classes last while Java serialization emits them first. This makes it difficult to match a given XML schema that
		defined inherited types or leads sometimes to obscure initialization problems. However, XStream itself will not be
		affected by the changed order of elements in the XML, any deserialization of current XML representations will work
		fine. Anyway we will provide with XStream 1.3 a FieldKeySorter implementation that mimics the old behaviour. In the
		meanwhile you can enforce the new field sorting by installing the NaturalFieldKeySorter.</p>

	</ul>

	<h1 id="1.1">Version 1.1</h1>

	<p>
		Released January 15, 2005. Focus on support for objects defining custom serialization using the standard <a
			href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/serialization/spec/serialTOC.html">Java serialization</a> mechanism.
	</p>

	<h2>Major changes</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>Provides drop in replacement for ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream, using
			XStream.createObjectInputStream() and XStream.createObjectOutputStream() and XStream.createObjectInputStream(). This
			provides support for streaming objects.</li>
		<li>Support for objects that specify their own serialization schemes by implementing readObject() and
			writeObject() (as in Java serialization spec). This includes support for ObjectInputStream.getFields() and
			ObjectOuputStream.putFields().</li>
		<li>Support for objects to serialize other objects to the stream by implementing writeReplace() (as in Java
			serialization spec).</li>
		<li>Support for any object that performs custom serialization by implementing java.io.Externalizable (as in Java
			serialization spec).</li>
		<li>Implicit collections can be specified for classes, allowing the element wrapping the collection to be
			skipped.</li>
		<li>New writer implementations to allow XStream to serialize directly to a SAX stream or TrAX pipeline.</li>
		<li>The MarshallingContext and UnmarshallingContext interfaces now extend DataHolder, allowing arbitrary data to
			be stored by the user whilst walking the object graph and passed around to Converters. DataHolders can also be passed
			into XStream from the outside.</li>
		<li>Includes new DomWriter implementation to serialize directly to a W3C DOM tree (to complement the existing
			DomReader).</li>
		<li>Better support for instantiating objects on non Sun 1.4+ JVMs, including non-public constructors, private
			static inner classes and ANY class that implements java.io.Serializable.</li>
		<li>DOM, DOM4J, JDOM, XOM, Electric-XML, SAX, STAX</li>
		<li>Specific ClassLoaders can be passed into XStream, to allow for greater compatibility in J2EE containers.</li>
		<li>Ability to change the default converter</li>
		<li>Added optional ISO8601DateConverter for full ISO8601 date format support. The converter is not registered by
			default as it requires the joda-time dependency (http://joda-time.sf.net). To use, ensure joda-time is in classpath
			and register explicitly.</li>
		<li>Enhanced mode is now supported on the Apple 1.4 JDK.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Minor changes</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>PrettyPrintWriter only flushes stream when necessary - large performance improvement for serialization.</li>
		<li>Added XStream.fromXml(xml, root) convenience methods for deserializing into an existing root object.</li>
		<li>JDK 1.3 compatibility: Added mechanism for accessing nested exception.</li>
		<li>JDK 1.3 compatibility: GregorianCalendarConverter only calls Calendar.getTimeInMillis() the JDK supports it.</li>
		<li>Bugfix: All caches are now synchronized - there were some thread safety issues.</li>
		<li>Bugfix: Only <i>immutable</i> basic types will have references ignored in XML (for clarity).
		</li>
		<li>Bugfix: Class names can contain underscores.</li>
		<li>Bugfix: Support for '\0' char.</li>
		<li>Bugfix: PropertyConverter no longer attempts to serialize subclasses of Properties.</li>
		<li>Bugfix: JVM detection uses system properties, which is more accurate than searching the classpath.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>API changes</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>XStream.addDefaultCollection() has been deprecated. Use XStream.addImplicitCollection() instead.</li>
	</ul>

	<h1 id="1.0.2">Version 1.0.2</h1>

	<p>Released August 7, 2004. Focus on improving the converters bundled with XStream to support a wider range of
		types.</p>

	<h2>Major changes</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>XML elements are written in order they are defined in class, rather than alphabetical.</li>
		<li>Converters for java.io.File, java.sql.Timestamp, java.awt.Color, and dynamic proxies are now registered by
			default.</li>
		<li>EncodedByteArrayConverter is now registered by default and uses a single Base64 string to store the contents
			of a byte[]. This now works on all JVMs as it no longer relies on Sun specific classes. This converter will also
			unmarshal byte[] that have been serialized without it, for backwards compatability.</li>
		<li>New converters for java.sql.Time, java.sql.Date, java.util.Locale, java.util.Currency, java.util.Calendar and
			java.awt.Font.</li>
		<li>All caching is done in XStream instance instead of statics, allowing applications that use hot redeployment
			of classes to use XStream in a parent classloader.</li>
		<li>XStream will fail fast if a field value is defined more than once in XML when deserializing.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Minor changes</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>The &lt;entry&gt; element used in Maps can now be specified by creating an alias for java.util.Map.Entry.</li>
