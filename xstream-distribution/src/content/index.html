    <title>Java to XML serialization, and back again</title>

  </head>

  <body>

    <p>XStream is a simple library to serialize objects to XML and back again.</p>

    <h1 id="features">Features</h1>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Ease of use.</b> A high level facade is supplied that simplifies common use cases.</li>
        <li><b>No mappings required.</b> Most objects can be serialized without need for specifying mappings.</li>
        <li><b>Performance.</b> Speed and low memory footprint are a crucial part of the design, making it suitable for
        large object graphs or systems with high message throughput.</li>
        <li><b>Clean XML.</b> No information is duplicated that can be obtained via reflection. This results
        in XML that is easier to read for humans and more compact than native Java serialization.</li>
        <li><b>Requires no modifications to objects.</b> Serializes internal fields, including private and
        final. Supports non-public and inner classes. Classes are not required to have default constructor.</li>
        <li><b>Full object graph support.</b> Duplicate references encountered in the object-model will
        be maintained. Supports circular references.</li>
        <li><b>Integrates with other XML APIs.</b> By implementing an interface, XStream can serialize
        directly to/from any tree structure (not just XML).</li>
        <li><b>Customizable conversion strategies.</b> Strategies can be registered allowing customization of how
        particular types are represented as XML.</li>
        <li><b>Error messages.</b> When an exception occurs due to malformed XML, detailed diagnostics are provided
        to help isolate and fix the problem.</li>
        <li><b>Alternative output format.</b> The modular design allows other output formats. XStream ships currently
        with JSON support and morphing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="use-cases">Typical Uses</h1>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Transport</b></li>
        <li><b>Persistence</b></li>
        <li><b>Configuration</b></li>
        <li><b>Unit Tests</b></li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="limitations">Known Limitations</h1>

    <p>If using the enhanced mode, XStream can re-instantiate classes that do not have a default constructor. 
    However, if using a different JVM like an old JRockit version, a JDK 1.4 or you have restrictions because of a 
    SecurityManager, a default constructor is required.</p>

    <p>The enhanced mode is also necessary to restore final fields for any JDK &lt; 1.5. This implies deserialization of
    instances of an inner class.</p>

    <p>Auto-detection of annotations may cause race conditions. Preprocessing annotations is safe though.</p>

    <h2 id="1.4"><b>Aug 6, 2011</b> XStream 1.4 released</h2>

      <p>Finally - XStream 1.4 is ready for delivery.  A lot of things have changed and improved, new features added.
      Nevertheless we have maintain compatibility to the old versions:</p>
      
      <ul>
      	<li>Detection of Java 7 and Android i.e. enabled enhanced mode and annotations for both environments out of the box</li>
      	<li>Direct support of XmlPullParser factory and alternate kXML2 implementation</li>
      	<li>Explicit drivers to select the StAX implementation</li>
      	<li>New separate Hibernate module to support those managed instances (special thanks to Jaime Metcher)</li>
      	<li>Support of implicit arrays and maps additionally to already existing implicit collection support</li>
      	<li>Performance improvements (special thanks to Keith Kowalczykowski)</li>
      	<li>Some new converters (for URI and one to write all fields but one as attributes)</li>
      	<li>A lot of other enhancements and bug fixes</li>
      </ul>

    <p class="hightlight">Note, that with version 1.4 the default parser has been changed from
    <a href="faq.html#Compatibility_kXML2">Xpp3 to kXML2</a>.</p>
      
    <p class="hightlight">Note, that JDK 1.3 support has been officially dropped.  Nothing special has been done to
    enforce this, but there is no longer any support.</p>

    <p class="highlight">Note, to support a representation of null values in some way, it is absolutely necessary that each converter can handle a null
    value in its marshalling methods.  If you have implemented your own custom converters, try to handle such a case also to prevent incompatibilities
    in case XStream will provide such values with its next major version.</p>
