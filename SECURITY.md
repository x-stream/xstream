## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have identified a security issue, please open a [new private security advisory](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/security/advisories/new).
Provide there all details to reproduce the problem with the latest XStream version.

Note, that XStream cares about security issues with XStream itself or in combination with the Java runtime, but not with
3rd party libraries. It is in the resposibility of each developer who brings those libraries together to setup the
[XStream Security Framework](https://x-stream.github.io/security.html#framework) properly.
